# Name: bootstrap
#
# Function: build spine from scratch
#
# Description: This script will take a vanilla Spine source
#              package and attempt to compile it.  It will
#              attempt to handle nasty things like dos2unix
#              issues in all files and searching for the
#              presence of required modules.
#
#              It is not a replacement for the auto tools,
#              but simply a supplement.
