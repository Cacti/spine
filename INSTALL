cactid: a backend data gatherer for cacti
------------------------------------------

Support will not be provided for this poller at this point!

Below are some random notes about installing:

- sometimes ./configure detects ucd-snmp when you really have net-snmp.
  I was able to remedy this by deleting my old ucd-snmp libraries in
  /usr/lib/libsnmp*
- right now cactid requires -lmysqlclient_r to compile (which may be
  removed in the future). It seems that the default Redhat (at least
  RH9) RPM's have trouble with this. The mysql.com RPMs work fine
  though.
- Make sure to edit cactid.conf
