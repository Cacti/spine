spine: a backend data gatherer for cacti
------------------------------------------
Compile Requirements:
 
- net-snmp-devel
- mysql
- mysql-devel
- openssl-devel
 
Below are some random notes about installing:

- to minimize the impact of MIB files for net-snmp, utilize the
  --disable-mib-loading configure option in net-snmp (vers 5.1 and above).
 
- Spine requires -lmysqlclient_r to compile. Some early distributions
  of MySQL did not include those libraries.  If that is the case, you
  will be required to compile and build against MySQL with thread
  safety enabled.  We suggest you simply use a modern distro of Linux.
  
- Be sure you have a good development environment including autoconf,
  automake and libtool to compile.
 
- There are a number of configure options.  To view them, run ./configure --help
  there are a few specific to Spine.  They are as follows:

  --enable-popen                    - By default, spine uses nitfy_popen.  The problem
                                      with popen is that if a script times out, there is
                                      not easy way to cleanup.
  --enable-threadsafe-gethostbyname - If your OS has a native threadsafe version of
                                      gethostbyname, enable use this option.
  --enable-solaris-priv             - Enable support for the Solaris process privilege 
                                      model (default: disabled)                                      
  --with-max-mysql-buffer=65536     - MySQL can handle very large insert buffers.
                                      Changing this size can alter spine performance.
                                      Make this value at least four times as large
                                      as the results-buffer.
  --with-results-buffer=1024        - Some scripts can have very large results that
                                      need to be returned to cacti's poller_output
                                      table.  You can control the size of this buffer
                                      using this option.
  --with-max-scripts=20             - Each spine process have launch several scripts.
                                      If your scripts have large amounts of "wait" time
                                      increasing this value may improve performance.  Keep
                                      in mind that this will increase server load.

- A file "bootstrap" has been included to simplify the build process for Linux systems
  with make and gcc.  It will install spine in /usr/bin.  If this is acceptable, try
  to run the bootstrap process first.  Otherwise, follow the instructions below.

- If ./configure fails with the error 'libtool.m4 and ltmain.sh have 
  a version mismatch!', run the following:
 
  aclocal
  libtoolize --force
  autoconf
  autoheader
  automake  

- Make sure to rename /etc/spine.conf.dist to spine.conf and make changes to match
  your database
